    "Intake philosophy contains a clear separation of concerns between the provider of data and\n",
    "the consumer of data. This tutorial concerns the former: someone who cares about where a\n",
    "particular dataset it stored and the right format and options for best retrieval. It is\n",
    "their task to make these choices, and then expose the data to end-users (such as data scientists),\n",
    "so that they have a clear path to finding and accessing their data. There is no need to\n",
    "train users in how to investigate or load a particular dataset, those details are encoded\n",
    "in the catalog.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intake catalogs act as a single source of truth about the data in question.\n",
    "The principal job of a data scientist, while interacting with Intake, is to find the\n",
    "best representation of data-sets (as they would have to do in any case) and to author\n",
    "catalogs as a means of both codifying the data-sets in versionable files and exposing\n",
    "them to users with a clear contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will show the work-flow for writing a catalog, and thereby providing\n",
    "data to your users."
